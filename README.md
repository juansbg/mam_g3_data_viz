The data chosen contains extensive information on flight paths and prices in and out of the United States of America, from 2020 to 2022 (The dates can be chosen depending on how much data we want to analyze).
The data description is as follows:
“
Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B) is a 10% sample of airline tickets from reporting carriers. Data includes origin, destination and other itinerary details of passengers transported.
”
The data allows us to create different visualizations related to different topics such as:
•	The evolution of prices over time
•	Comparing flights by geography (e.g. Domestic vs International flights)
•	Airport usage
•	Airline behaviors (e.g. Cluster types of airlines)
•	Flight patterns
•	Air fares
